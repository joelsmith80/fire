                  <p>The images come from many world cultures and different eras and represent many mediums and styles. Diversity increases the flexibility of participants’ thinking as they realize they can find meaning in all sorts of visual languages.</p>
                  <p>When we talk about art, our eyes and minds work together to combine perceptions, logic, memory, reason, imagination, information, and common sense. We draw on our experiences as well as our creativity. We find language to express ideas that matter.</p>

											<p>Many cognitive scientists tell us that learning best occurs when the learner is ready for the challenges provided. The VTS Image Curriculum is chosen to correspond to existing and building capacities of art viewer. Therefore, image selection is a careful process rooted in the foundations of aesthetic development theory. In order to begin the complicated process of image selection keep the following considerations top of mind.</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Are the images interesting to the audience?</li>
												<li>Are the images ambiguous — is there an authentic problem to solve?</li>
												<li>Is there a possible narrative to interpret?</li>
												<li>Is the image accessible — representational or realistic?</li>
												<li>Would a sequence of images help support growth in participants' thinking and/or problem solving strategies?</li>

This silent moment allows participants to begin the process of observing, inferring, and meaning-making. The silent moment should be long enough for the group to read the entire image — about 30 seconds. Facilitators should use this time to both observe the image and reflect on their own practice.</p>

                <div class="main">
                  <p>Facilitators ask only three questions. Fidelity to these questions and the wording is critical to developing the habits of mind necessary for independent critical thinking, and skilled communication.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <h3>1. What's going on in this picture?</h3>
                      <p>This question opens the conversation. We ask it only once. The phrasing suggests the image is about something. It encourages storytelling and the opportunity for participants to think and speak for themselves.</p>
											<p>For pre-kindergarten through first grade during the first few VTS lessons, you may choose to ask the question: "What do you <em>see</em> in this picture?"</p>
											<p>During the first few VTS lessons, ask the question, "What do you see in this picture?" This question meets young viewers in a developmentally appropriate way. Once you begin to hear students infer things from an image — going beyond observations such as "I see a girl" to comments like "I think she is sad" — initiate the discussions with "What's going on in this picture" – a question that drives this more sophisticated way of meaning-making.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>2. What do you see that makes you say ...?</h3>
                      <p>This question asks participants to look more and gather evidence to support ideas or interpretations. Finding evidence in the image supports the skill of fact-based reasoning and debate in any context.</p>
                      <p>Ask this question whenever you hear an inference, even if you agree with the opinion or you think you know what the participant refers to. In this question, VTS provides the opportunity for us to articulate and examine the "why" behind our assumptions and observations. We only ask this question once per student interaction. One follow-up question per student maintains neutrality and honors the goal of hearing as many voices as possible in a discussion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <h3>3. What more can you find?</h3>
                      <p>We ask this question after each paraphrase to encourage thorough examination of the image. This question is a very direct way of pushing beyond early impressions. It has the effect of making the conversation richer and more complete. Long term, the repetition of "What more can you find?" supports perseverance. Research shows that the capacity to probe — to move beyond what is obvious — needs to be nurtured to grow.</p>

                <div class="main">
                  <p>The paraphrase can be considered the most nuanced and complex tool we have as facilitators. As we begin the practice of facilitation, it is helpful to identify the specific objectives of the paraphrase. When you paraphrase, you:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>ensure that everyone in the group hears each idea</li>
                    <li>underscore the fact that listening to and trying to understand others is important</li>
                    <li>indicate that you have not just heard but also understood them, encouraging participants to engage</li>
                    <li>build participants' sense of being valued and capable</li>
                    <li>model clearer, crisper language, grammar, and vocabulary</li>
                    <li>access authentic, student-centered perspectives</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>As a part of teaching critical thinking, you need to emphasize the importance of considering all possibilities. The VTS process allows students to find the interpretations that mean the most to them, thus encouraging further learning.</p>

											<p>Working together in VTS discussions, participants can solve complex problems and decipher meaning from the artwork. Peer interactions lead to more observation, more ideas, and usually greater accuracy. Debating and building on the ideas of each other provides an opportunity to stretch one's reasoning skills.</p>
											<p>In order to encourage this behavior of critical analysis and response to others' ideas, facilitators should keep track of various strands of thought and draw links among them while paraphrasing. This can mean pointing out when comments are in agreement or opposition, as well as elaborations or revisions.</p>
											<p>When the facilitator links various ideas, creating a kind of outline of the discussion as it builds, participants become aware of how thinking unfolds and how meanings are discovered.</p>

											<p>In more advanced paraphrasing, we include the tool of framing ideas and thinking for the benefit of the group as a whole. Framing involves beginning paraphrases with language that contextualizes the comments and makes clear the lens they are using to approach the image.

											<p>Possible categories for the frame include:</p>
											<p><b>Identifying the big idea in a comment</b></p>
